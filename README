Run function createPlaintext with the following format:
createPlaintext(ENC/DEC, empty vector)

To input the plaintext or ciphertext, pipe it into cin using the terminal with a text file.
The plaintext/ciphertext should be in hex.

Run function keyGenerator with an empty vector passed in to generate a 256-bit key

Call the speckClass constructor in the following format:
speckClass specky(Encryption/Decryption, WORDSIZE (64), # rounds (CORRESPONDING ROUNDS = 34), plaintext/ciphertext vector, key vector)

where Encryption would be passed in plaintext and Decryption passed in ciphertext
